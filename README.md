# Kanbas Node Backend

This is the backend infastructure for my kanbas project. It setups the endpoints utilized by the [frontend](https://github.com/RyanLake6/kanbas-react-app) of the application.

This project was an excercise within the NEU CS 4550 Web Development class to learn Node.js and MongoDB as well as to further improve my javascript skills.

- It stores all data within a noSQL MongoDB which is hosted through [MongoDB Atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/products/platform/atlas-database)
- The Node.js server is deployed through [Render](https://render.com/)
